# Introduction
## What is inclusive language?
Inclusive language is communication that avoids bias, slang, and expressions that discriminate against people based on characteristics such as gender, race, ability, age, or other identities. It promotes clarity, respect, and accessibility, ensuring that all users feel acknowledged and valued.

## Why inclusive language matters for users and organizations

### For users:
- **Makes content accessible** â€“ Clear, simple language helps everyone understand, including people with different abilities or language skills.  
- **Creates a better experience** â€“ When users see themselves represented, they feel respected and engaged.  
- **Reduces confusion** â€“ Biased or unclear words can be misunderstood, especially by non-native speakers.  
- **Includes a global audience** â€“ Technical documents are used worldwide. Inclusive language makes them useful for more people.  

### For organizations:
- **Builds a good reputation** â€“ Companies that use inclusive language show social responsibility and earn trust.  
- **Reaches more customers** â€“ Products become accessible to a wider audience, including people with disabilities and international users.  
- **Aligns with diversity goals** â€“ Many companies focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Inclusive language supports these values.  
- **Reduces legal risks** â€“ Some industries require inclusive language for accessibility standards like WCAG and ADA compliance.  
- **Supports employees** â€“ A workplace that values inclusive communication creates a better environment for employees.  

By using inclusive language, organizations improve user experience, strengthen their reputation, and expand their market.


# Core principles & examples of inclusive language  

## 1. Person-first language  
Focus on the person, not their condition or situation.  

âœ… **Do this:** Mention the person before the characteristic.  
ðŸš« **Avoid:** Labels that define someone by a trait.

## 2. Gender-inclusive writing

## 3. Cultural sensitivity  
Cultural sensitivity ensures language respects all backgrounds and avoids terms that may be offensive or exclusive.
